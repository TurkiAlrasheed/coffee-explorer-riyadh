    <h1>Riyadh Cafes</h1>

<p>
    Each cafe on the map is assigned a <strong>score (out of 5)</strong> that reflects both its average user rating and its popularity. Here's how the score is calculated:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Normalize</strong> both rating and rating_count to a 0-1 range:</li>
    <pre><code>rating_norm = (rating - min) / (max - min)
popularity_norm = (rating_count - min) / (max - min)</code></pre>

    <li><strong>Combine</strong> the normalized values using a weighted average:</li>
    <pre><code>score = 5 x (0.9 x rating_norm + 0.1 x popularity_norm)</code></pre>

    <li>
        This gives more importance to the average rating (90%) while still accounting for how many users rated the cafe (10%).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The final result is a score between 0 and 5. Hover over each point on the map to see its name, original rating, number of ratings, and computed score.
